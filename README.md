# powNotify

The tiny, performant go-based decred ***pow*** notification tool.

## Getting started

Make sure [Golang](https://golang.org) has been installed and added to $PATH.

Then:

`go get github.com/matthewjamesr/powNotify`

## Running

`powNotify -rpcuser USERNAME -rpcpass PASSWORD`

When in doubt, `powNotify -help`.
